 Bioinformatics School Projects

 This repository is to showcase some small projects (homework) that I have done during my studies in university.

 Most of these projects only work on bioinformatics data as to serve for courses in Master of Bioinformatics program in KU Leuven, Belgium.

### Contents:
 * Project 1: Java - OOP
 * Project 2: Data analysis - R
 * Project 3: Single-cell RNAseq (Python) - CHiPseq (Bash)
 * Project 4: Snakemake - SNP calling workflow
 * Project 5: Bash/Shell - Python file manipulation (Basic)
 
## Project 1: Java - OOP

The HIV.fasta file is managed by an bioinformatic team, including 1 Team Leader, 1 Technician, 3 Bioinformaticians. The information of the team is stored in a text file. The goal of the project is to store the fasta file as a repository, allowing different modified alingment versions from the Bioinformaticians. Different members in the team have different permission of accessing the repository. Every modification of the genome alignment is reported.

This project enhances skills in reading, writing, backing up files using Java, along with assigning the correct function of each member using OOP towards manipulating these files. This project was used in the "Introduction to OOP Programming" course.

## Project 2: Data analysis - R

In this project, dataset of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals is classified using multivariate data analysis techniques in R. Data is retrieved from data.mendeley.com/datasets/wj9rwkp9c2/1. The goal of this project is to classify the diabetic patients based on their biological variables, using PCA (Principle Components Analysis) and clustering method.
    
This project was used in the "Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis" course.

## Project 3: Single-cell RNAseq and CHiPseq
### Single-cell RNAseq:

In this project, the single-cell RNA-seq analysis is carried out to learn more about the immune system in the skin and blood. The dataset is retrieved from paper: ***Single-cell analysis reveals innate lymphoid cell lineage infidelity in atopic dermatitis*** ([Natalia Alkon et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.07.025)). This study investigated role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) by using single-cell RNA-sequencing on skin cells and blood cells from healthy individuals and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

The analysis was written in Python language using Jupyter Notebooks. This project was used in the "Regulatory Genomics" course.

### CHiPseq:

In this project, the ChIP-seq analysis is carried out to learn more about ETS1 transcription factor in natural killer cells (NK cell) in human, based on paper ***The transcription factor ETS1 is an important regulator of human NK cell development and terminal differentiation*** ([Sylvie Taveirne et al](https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020005204)).

The analysis was written in Bash using Jupyter Notebooks. This project was used in the "Regulatory Genomics" course.

## Project 4: 

In this project, the SNP calling workflow was carried out using Snakemake. 11 fastq files from 11 samples are aligned and searched for SNP variants associating with APP, SOD1, DYRK1A genes that are considered to be key genes in Alzheimer's disease.

Bash and Python were both used in the project serving analyzing and plotting data. This project was used in "Management of Large-Scale Omics Data" course.

## Project 5:
