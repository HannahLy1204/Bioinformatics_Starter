# Bioinformatics_Starter
Bioinformatics School Project
This repository is to showcase some small projects (homework) that I have done during my studies in university.
Most of these projects only work on bioinformatics data as to serve for courses in Master of Bioinformatics program in KU Leuvenm Belgium.

### Contents:
 * Project 1: Java - OOP
 * Project 2: Data analysis - R
 * Project 3: Single-cell RNAseq (Python) - CHiPseq (Bash)
 * Project 4: Snakemake - SNP calling workflow
 * Project 5: Bash/Shell - Python file manipulation
 
 

## Project 1: Java - OOP
    The HIV.fasta file is managed by an bioinformatic team, including 1 Team Leader, 1 Technician, 3 Bioinformaticians. The information of the team is stored in a text file. The goal of the project is to store the fasta file as a repository, allowing different modified alingment versions from the Bioinformaticians. Different members in the team have different permission of accessing the repository. Every modification of the genome alignment is reported.

    This project enhances skills in reading, writing, backing up files using Java, along with assigning the correct function of each member using OOP towards manipulating these files. This project was used in the "Introduction to OOP Programming" course.

## Project 2: Data analysis - R
    In this project, dataset of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals is classified using multivariate data analysis techniques in R. Data is retrieved from data.mendeley.com/datasets/wj9rwkp9c2/1. The goal of this project is to classify the diabetic patients based on their biological variables, using PCA (Principle Components Analysis) and clustering method.
    
    This project was used in the "Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis" course.

## Project 3: Single-cell RNAseq and CHiPseq
